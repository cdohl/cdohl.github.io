We are an experimental group at the [Otto-von-Guericke-University](https://www.ovgu.de/). Our aim is to explore not so simple flows on small scales.. 
 
{% include carousel.html %}

We work on problems such as 

* photo **acoustics**, time reversal acoustics, shockwaves in medicine

* gas **bubble dynamics**, cavitation, nanobubbles, jets, fragmentation

* elastic waves in tissue, and 

* heat transfer in boiling.

We are located at the Otto-von-Guericke-University, named after the founder of vacuum technolgy Otto von Guericke who built a first empty cavity.

 **We are  looking for passionate new Master and Bachelor students, PhD and Postdocs students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**
