# Research

We conduct experimental research on small scales with complex fluids. A big part of the research is devoted to gas and vapor bubbles, the deformation of biological cells, the response of biological material to acoustic waves, and fluid dynamics on the nanoscale.

Research of the SoftMatter Lab is mostly curiosity driven. I became interested in the peculiarities of bubbles from the phenomenon of [sonoluminescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoluminescence). It is basically the conversion of kinetic energy from the fluid into photons.

More on research soon!
